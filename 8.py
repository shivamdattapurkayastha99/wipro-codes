# A digital machine generates binary data which consists of a string of 0s and 1s.
#  A maximum signal M, in the data, consists of the maximum number of either 1s or 0s appearing consecutively 
#  in the data but M canâ€™t be at the beginning or end of the string.
#   Design a way to find the length of the maximum signal.....
